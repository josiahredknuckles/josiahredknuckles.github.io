        <p1>isn't it crazy how crazy we were for each other? And again we are where we started: starngers. I hope you find someone who will make you happy. Happier than i could have ever made you. You deserve only the best. I'm just sad that I couldn't be that guy. I'm sorry that I hurt you, but I didn't want to weigh you down. You have your whole life ahead of you and I don't want you to waste it on something that won't last forever. Forgive me for the tears and sadness. But I hope you still remeember the fun we had. I don't think I could ever forget you. </p1>
