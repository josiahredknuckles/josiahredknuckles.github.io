        <h2>I don't think anything really lasts</h2>
        <p1>And just as the seasons changed, so did our feelings. We grew apart. The colors that filled my bedroom as I lay alseep died away, and I knew in my heart it just wasn't the same. I felt the longing to want you again, but I knew that the spark for you drowned in the confines of time and change. I felt a void grow deeper inside, an endless abyss that couldn't be filled. I wanted to love but I was lost in the dramatic scene of it all: life as I knew it was altering. But the oddest thing was that I knew you felt the same; that you wanted to love, but couldn't find a reason to anymore.  </p1>

        <h2>I don't think I'll forget you</h2>
        <p1>Even though our feelings faded away, I can't even fathom the thought of forgetting you. You lit up my life in ways that I know no one else possibly could. You were really something special, and I just want to thank you for existing, and allowing me to have you, even as short as our relationship was. You made me write songs and do things I never would have even dreamed of doing; Because, for a while, you were my entire world.

             <p> Isn't it crazy how crazy we were for each other? And again we are where we started: starngers. I hope you find someone who will make you happy. Happier than I could have ever made you. You deserve only the stars in the sky. I'm just sad that I couldn't be that guy to give them to you. I'm sorry if I hurt you, but I didn't want to weigh you down. You have your whole life ahead of you and I don't want you to waste it on something that won't last forever. Forgive me for the tears and sadness. But I hope you still remeember the fun we had. I don't think I could ever forget you.</p>

        <h2>But I think this is goodbye </h2>
        <p1>I hope that, even in the slightest, this made you smile or remember us just for a moment; I don't have any regrets. I don't have any remorse. You filled a chapter in my life with wonder and beauty. And maybe there is pain, but don't worry, Dear, it will all go away. I wish you only the best and to find true happiness, wherever it may be. Don't be afraid to fall again. Just keep growing, and don't look back. Take care, my Dear.  </p1>
